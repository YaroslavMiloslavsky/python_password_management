# Password Tool

[![Product Name Screen Shot][screenshot]]

Ever wanted to try a CLI base tool for generating and storing passwords?
<br>
Well now you can!
<br>
With the CLI tool you can manage your passwords offline in a terminal.
<br>
Or... you could play around and break the code

<br>

## Why Should You Bother At All?
The passwords, both user passowrd and saved passowrds are being encrypted, so there is no way one could just take them and use them
